# Introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of web development. It's a markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. HTML documents consist of elements, or tags, which define how content should be displayed in a web browser.

## Key Concepts in HTML

### 1. Elements and Tags

HTML uses elements enclosed in angle brackets (tags) to define the structure and content of a web page. For example, `<h1>` is a tag used to create a top-level heading, and `<p>` is used for paragraphs.

### 2. Document Structure

Every HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, followed by an `<html>` element. Inside the `<html>` element, you have two main sections: `<head>` for meta-information and external resource links, and `<body>` for the visible content.

### 3. Text and Headings

HTML allows you to structure text with headings (`<h1>` to `<h6`>) and paragraphs (`<p>`). Headings create a hierarchy of titles, with `<h1>` being the highest level.

### 4. Lists

You can create ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`) using list items (`<li>`). Lists are used to organize content.

### 5. Links

Hyperlinks are created with the `<a>` (anchor) element. You specify the destination URL using the `href` attribute.

### 6. Images

Images are displayed using the `<img>` element, with the source image specified in the `src` attribute.

### 7. Forms

HTML provides various form elements, such as `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button`, for collecting user input.

### 8. Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or configuration. For example, the `src` attribute in the `<img>` element specifies the image source.

### 9. Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML elements, like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer`, enhance the structure and accessibility of your web pages.

### 10. Validation

Writing valid HTML is important for consistency and browser compatibility. Online HTML validation tools can help you check your code for errors.

HTML is the core language for creating web content. It defines the structure of web pages, and, in combination with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, forms the basis of modern web development. Learning HTML is a crucial step for anyone interested in building websites or web applications.
